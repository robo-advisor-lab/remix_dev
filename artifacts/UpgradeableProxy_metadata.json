This address is stored in storage in the location specified by https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967[EIP1967], so that it doesn't conflict with the storage layout of the implementation behind the proxy. Upgradeability is only provided internally through {_upgradeTo}. For an externally upgradeable proxy see {TransparentUpgradeableProxy}.",
